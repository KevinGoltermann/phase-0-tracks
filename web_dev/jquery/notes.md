-Intro videos
	-I think intro videos are really prodcutive because they usually give a step by step visualization of the process
-Any quick written tutorials on JQuery site itself, then check Google
-Check slack for any input from other students

-Try and check my knowledge after every big learning point
-Code along with video if possible

-Take breaks every 30 mins
-Make sure not to go down the rabbit hole

-I tried the videos at first, and for some reason I just couldn't follow along very well. I think the thing that worked best for me was the tutorial on W3 schools. I have used them alot and they seem to lay out the instructions very well.
