# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a record keeping tecnique that tracks various files over time and allows you to go back and track older versions. This is useful because it can allow you to find when a mistake was created or track other issues to exact times.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master that allows you to work on the same exact information but without directly affecting the master version. You would use one so that you don't accidentally mess up the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a way to save the files that have been worked on. A good commit message is one that begins with a short line summarizing what was changed followed by a blank line and then a more in depth description to allow a person to know exactly what was changed. 
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can happen when there are disagreeing conflicts. This means a conflict will happen when the current branch and the branch we're trying to merge into the current branch have divereged aka there are commits in the current branch that are not in the othere branch.
