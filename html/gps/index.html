<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to be able to create order within your code. It creates a sort of tree where you can lay our the most important parts of the code, followed by info that goes within that code. On a visual basis, it helps give layout to the page by letting the browser know where to put certain info and which infocan be kept across all pages. One of the ones that I think is the most useful is the <nav> tag because that tag is going to be carried through all the pages and will allow the user to actually navigate the site. Also, I like the article and section tags because it helps gives priority to the code and helps me visualze where the info should be going. -->

<!-- A browser reads HTML code from top to bottom, like a book. This means that the code has to be layed out in the order that you want it to appear on webpage. For example, a subtopic must be written out below its parent topic in order to make sense. Also, heading elements are given a rank by the number in the element name, which gives that element certain priority when being displayed by the browser. -->

<!-- In this challenge, I have learned about creating snippets and how easy it is. I have found this extremely useful because it will allow me to create snippets of usually long, tedious code so that whenever I need to access it, I can just use the snippet. I also learned more about the order of HTML pages and how to lay out the info. I know I will definitley create more snippets as I continue to learn more and use my knowledge in real world applications. -->

<!-- The hardest part for me in this challege is remebering what exactly all the tags mean. Most of the time I can assume from what the actual word is, but sometimes its not very obvious and I have to look up what a tag means or what tag I need to accomplish a certain task. I think I will slowly be able to improve this by just constantly using tags. I think the more I work with this info and the more I see the tags, the more I will understand what each one means. -->
